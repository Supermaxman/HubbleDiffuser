# Hubble Diffusion v1: Stable Diffusion v1.4 fine tuned on ESA Hubble Deep Space Images & Captions

Put in a detailed text prompt and generate Hubble Deep Space Images!

## Model Details

- **Developed by:** Maxwell Weinzierl
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model
- **Language(s):** English
- **License:** [The CreativeML OpenRAIL M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) is an [Open RAIL M license](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses), adapted from the work that [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) and [the RAIL Initiative](https://www.licenses.ai/) are jointly carrying in the area of responsible AI licensing. See also [the article about the BLOOM Open RAIL license](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license) on which our license is based.
- **Model Description:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a [Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) that uses a fixed, pretrained text encoder ([CLIP ViT-L/14](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)) as suggested in the [Imagen paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487).

## Examples

We recommend using [ðŸ¤—'s Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to run Hubble Diffusion.

### Usage

```bash
!pip install transformers diffusers accelerate
```

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

model_id = "Supermaxman/hubble-diffusion-1"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
# saves significant GPU memory for small inference cost
pipe.enable_attention_slicing()

prompt = "Hubble snaps images of the birthplace of stars within a cluster: The dust and gas expand within the cluster due to the powerful influence of baby stars. With these new images comes improved detail and a clearer view for astronomers to study how early stars are born and change over time."
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image
```

## Model description

Trained on [ESA Hubble Deep Space Images & Captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Supermaxman/esa-hubble) using [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) with a single A100 GPU for around 33,000 steps (about 12 hours, at a cost of about $20).
