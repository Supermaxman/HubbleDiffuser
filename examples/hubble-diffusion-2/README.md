## Model Details

- **Developed by:** Maxwell Weinzierl
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model
- **Language(s):** English
- **License:** [CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL)
- **Model Description:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a [Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) that uses a fixed, pretrained text encoder ([OpenCLIP-ViT/H](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)).

## Examples

We recommend using [ðŸ¤—'s Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to run Hubble Diffusion.

### Usage

```bash
pip install transformers diffusers accelerate
```

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

model_id = "Supermaxman/hubble-diffusion-2"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
# saves significant GPU memory for small inference cost
pipe.enable_attention_slicing()

prompt = "Hubble snaps images of the birthplace of stars within a cluster: The dust and gas expand within the cluster due to the powerful influence of baby stars. With these new images comes improved detail and a clearer view for astronomers to study how early stars are born and change over time."
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image
```

## Model description

Trained on [ESA Hubble Deep Space Images & Captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Supermaxman/esa-hubble) using [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) with a single A100 GPU for around 33,000 steps (about 12 hours, at a cost of about $20).
